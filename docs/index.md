# Welcome to Roy' Secret Garden!

Greetings, travelers! Welcome to my humble corner of the internet. I am Roy Kid, an adventurer in the world of academia. Please, take a moment to rest your weary feet and peruse my latest discoveries and musings. Perhaps we can even embark on a quest of knowledge together!

I am studying for my Ph.D. at Uppsala University in Sweden in [Zhang Chao](https://tec-group.github.io/) & [Daniel Brandell](https://www.katalog.uu.se/empinfo/?id=N99-854)'s Group, researching solid electrolytes in lithium-ion batteries. I have been involved in computational work focused on molecular dynamics simulations, and am currently expanding my skills to include the development and application of machine learning force field and quantum calculations.

I obtained my Master's degree from the University of Science and Technology of China before joining Zhang's Group. Prior to this, I worked as an intern at [DP Tech](https://dp.tech/), contributing to the development of [DMFF](https://github.com/deepmodeling/DMFF) under the supervision of Zhang Linfeng and Yu Kuang. DMFF is a Jax-based python package that provides a differentiable implementation of molecular force field models. I am passionate about coding and maintaining open-source projects, such as [MolPy](https://github.com/Roy-Kid/molpy) and [MolVis](https://github.com/Roy-Kid/molvis), to enhance scientific productivity and streamline workflows in computational chemistry research.
